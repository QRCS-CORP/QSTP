 * \brief The server connection collection.
 *
 * \details
 * This header defines a set of internal functions for managing the QSTP connection collection.
 * The connection collection is an array or list of QSTP connection state objects that represent
 * active or available network connections. These functions provide mechanisms to:
 *
 * - Check the active status of a connection at a given index.
 * - Add a new connection state to the collection.
 * - Retrieve connection states by instance number or by index.
 * - Initialize, clear, reset, and dispose of the entire connection collection.
 * - Determine the number of available connection states and the total size of the collection.
 *
 * Additionally, a self-test function is provided to verify the correct operation of the connection
 * collection management routines. The self-test exercises various operations including addition,
 * retrieval, reset, and disposal of connection state items.
 *
 * \note These functions are internal and non-exportable.
